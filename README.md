# The Full Story –
Kind Ideas was a simple thought that posed to my mind after watching the Ellen Show. She ends each of her shows by saying: “Be Kind to One Another.” 
After hearing her say this phrase for the 100th time, it finally clicked for me. We all can say how we're doing great things, we can say that we give to charity,
and we can claim that we’re making a difference. But is any of that doing any good? (Hear me out!) When we give to charity are we being kind to those people
who we are giving to? If you give to a homeless shelter, yet yell and make fun of the homeless on the streets—what good did your giving really even do? 

For many of us, we’re busy. We’re too busy to come up with a way to be Kind to another Human being! 
This is why I decided to use technology to solve a problem that I strongly believe in. I built a website, that is essentially a Kind Ideas Generator. If someone needs help coming up with something nice to say to someone, or needs an idea of what to give someone — it is my hope this website will help!
